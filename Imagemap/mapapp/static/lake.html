                Lakes are generally formed as a consequence of tectonic or glacial activity .This lake is a good art of nature. 
                Even a single stone's throw from the bustling city, offers a picturesque escape into nature's arms. 
                Surrounded by smoky city, its glassy surface reflects the sky's changing moods, from dawn's gentle hues to twilight's vibrant tapestry. 
                The gentle lap of water and the distant call of birds create a symphony of peace, inviting visitors to pause and breathe in the beauty. 
                Paths, worn by the feet of countless wanderers, meander around its edge, promising solitude and reflection. As seasons change, so does the lake, each visit offering a new portrait of serenity. 
                a reminder of the quiet wonders lying just beyond the rush of daily life.
