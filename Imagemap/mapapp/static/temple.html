                the temple main god is Lord Shiva, who is workshipped as the god of innocent and also called as the Bluethroatted.In the heart of the town, where silence gathers,
                Stands the ancient Siva temple, time's own partner. Its spire, a silhouette against the dawn, gathers Devotees, in prayer, seeking peace and ardor. A sacred space, where faith and heritage entwine.
                There is a temple at the entrance of the village where often prayers, rituals, and other worshipping activities are taking place.
                There is a big pond near the temple and is surrounded by mango trees, Neem tree,etc.,
                 The smell of the flowers and mango buds attracts everyone's attention.
